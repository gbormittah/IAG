Intelligent Ambience Generator - Using procedural audio to create realistic environments.

This project is currently in pre-alpha with tons of improvements and enhancements in the pipeline. Please be aware that the source files were created in PD-Extended and is likely to misbehave if launched with the vanilla distribution.

To test the current version, copy the source files into your current PD directory and type IAG~ in an object box. Alternatively you can open the IAG recording patch which has basic recording functionality.

Please feel free to get involved in the project and drop me an email if you have any questions. 

I'd like to say a massive thank you to Andy Farnell (http://obiwannabe.co.uk/) and credit a large amount of the current effects to his book 'Designing Sound'.
